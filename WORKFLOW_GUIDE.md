# MDM System - Workflow Guide

## 🌿 Branch Structure Overview

Your MDM repository now has a complete branch structure for collaborative development:

```
📦 MDM Repository
├── 🏠 main (Production - Company Use)
├── 📊 content (Backend/Data - My Work)
├── 🎨 bolt_ui (Frontend Design - Bolt AI)
└── 🔄 merge_test (Integration Testing - Your Review)
```

## 🔄 Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Current State ✅
- **main**: Contains the working Phase 1 dashboard
- **content**: Ready for my backend/data work
- **bolt_ui**: Ready for Bolt AI's frontend work
- **merge_test**: Ready for integration testing

### Phase 2: Development Workflow

#### 1. My Work (Backend/Data/Content)
```bash
# I'll work on the 'content' branch
git checkout content
# Add BigQuery integration, authentication, APIs
# Push updates regularly
```

#### 2. Bolt AI Work (Frontend/UI)
```bash
# Bolt AI works on 'bolt_ui' branch
git checkout bolt_ui
# Improve UI design, add components, enhance UX
# Push design updates
```

#### 3. Integration Testing (Your Review)
```bash
# You merge both branches into 'merge_test'
git checkout merge_test
git merge content
git merge bolt_ui
# Test the combined functionality
# Review before promoting to main
```

#### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# After testing approval, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge merge_test
# Deploy to production
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Test Phase 1**: Verify the dashboard works at http://localhost:3000
2. **Share with Bolt AI**: Give them access to the `bolt_ui` branch
3. **Plan Phase 2**: Decide on priority features for backend development

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Backend Development**: I'll start on real data integration
2. **UI Enhancement**: Bolt AI improves the frontend design
3. **Regular Syncing**: Weekly merges to `merge_test` for review

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Full Integration**: Complete MDM system with governance
2. **User Testing**: Deploy to staging for stakeholder feedback
3. **Production Deployment**: Launch the full system

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Protected Information
- **Service Account Keys**: Never commit to any branch
- **Environment Variables**: Use .env files (already in .gitignore)
- **Database Credentials**: Store in secure environment variables
- **API Keys**: Use Google Secret Manager or similar

### Branch Protection
- **main**: Should be protected, require PR reviews
- **content**: Contains sensitive backend configurations
- **merge_test**: Final testing before production
